## About Me
Hi, I'm Shirin! I have an academic background in Economics and Finance and am currently pursuing my MA in Economics, Data, and Policy at Central European University. I’m passionate about applying data-driven approaches to understand financial markets, evaluate economic trends, and support evidence-based decision-making.

Over the course of my studies and projects, I’ve built a solid foundation in econometrics, financial analysis, and data science tools such as Python, Stata, and LaTeX. I enjoy exploring data to uncover insights that can make financial and economic analysis more transparent and impactful.

My experiences as a former Bank Teller and Teaching Assisstant have strengthened my attention to detail, problem-solving mindset, and ability to work in collaborative environments.

In my free time, I love expanding my knowledge in finance, risk management, and data engineering while working on projects that combine economic theory with real-world data. I’m eager to grow as a financial data analyst and contribute to innovative, data-informed financial solutions.

This repository is a space where I share my projects, document my learning journey, and showcase my skills in data analysis and finance.

## Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases my work on **three major data analysis assignments** combining economics, finance, and predictive modeling.

---

### 1. CPS Earnings – Predicting Hourly Earnings
**Goal:** Build linear regression models to predict individuals’ earnings per hour using CPS dataset.  

**Tasks:**
- Select and filter occupation-specific data.  
- Build **four OLS models** from simple to complex.  
- Evaluate models using RMSE, cross-validated RMSE, and BIC.  
- Analyze relationship between model complexity and performance.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels

### 2. Airbnb Pricing Model
**Goal:** Develop a predictive pricing model for Airbnb listings in a selected city.  

**Tasks:**
- Prepare dataset, handle missing values, extract features.  
- Build **five models**: OLS, LASSO, Random Forest, Boosting, alternative model.  
- Compare models by performance and computation time.  
- Analyze feature importance in RF and Boosting models.  
- Test model robustness with a later dataset and a different city dataset.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Machine Learning

### 3. Bisnode Firms – Predicting Fast-Growing Firms
**Goal:** Predict firm growth and identify high-potential firms using panel data (2010–2015).  

**Tasks:**
- Define “fast growth” target variable with business justification.  
- Build **three predictive models**, including Logit and Random Forest.  
- Evaluate models with cross-validation and expected loss.  
- Perform classification with business loss function, optimize threshold, and compare industries (manufacturing vs. services).  
- Present confusion matrices and interpret results.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
